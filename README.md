# 6502js
A JavaScript 6502 assembler and simulator which runs in a web browser, forked from: https://github.com/skilldrick/6502js

Enhancements include a speed control (slider), load/save buttons, an 80x25 character memory-mapped terminal screen, and some basic ROM routines.

A hosted copy is available at http://6502.cdot.systems - Click the "Notes" button and scroll through the text box at the bottom of the display for basic documentation, including links to some sample code.
